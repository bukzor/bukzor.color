# Claude Agent Documentation

This directory contains modular documentation to help Claude (and similar AI agents) work effectively with this codebase.

## Core Modules

- **[bash.md](bash.md)** - Shell scripting patterns and best practices
- **[git.md](git.md)** - Git workflow conventions and commands
- **[development.md](development.md)** - Language-agnostic development practices
- **[tool-use.md](tool-use.md)** - Claude-specific tool usage patterns

## Quick Start for Claude Agents

1. Review these modules before starting work
2. Check project-specific `CLAUDE.md` in repository root for overrides
3. Follow patterns consistently across all changes

## Purpose

These conventions were established through real development experience to:
- Prevent common pitfalls
- Ensure consistent code quality
- Maintain clean git history
- Support multi-language development

## Portability

These modules are designed to be reusable across projects. Copy `.claude/` to new repositories and customize as needed.
